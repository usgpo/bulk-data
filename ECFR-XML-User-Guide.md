# 1. Introduction

The U.S. Government Publishing Office (GPO) and the National Archives and Records Administration's Office of the Federal Register (OFR) are making Electronic Code of Federal Regulation (e-CFR) XML files available via the [FDsys Bulk Data Repository](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/bulkdata). The e-CFR is a currently updated version of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). It is not an official legal edition of the CFR. The e-CFR is an editorial compilation of CFR material and _Federal Register_ amendments produced by the OFR and the GPO. The OFR will update the material in the e-CFR on an irregular basis that can be as frequent as every day. Please see [www.ecfr.gov](http://www.ecfr.gov/) for additional information.

The effort to provide Federal Government information in more open formats began when the President challenged Federal agencies to create a more open and transparent government, promote accountability, and provide information to citizens about what their Government is doing (see 74 FR 4685, January 26, 2009 at [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2009-01-26/pdf/E9-1777.pdf](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2009-01-26/pdf/E9-1777.pdf)). The Director's letter of March 9, 2009 pledged to provide trusted information in whatever form is required to meet the President's objectives [http://www.gpo.gov/pdfs/news-media/letter\_030909.pdf](http://www.gpo.gov/pdfs/news-media/letter_030909.pdf).

## 1.1. Purpose

The purpose of this document is to provide an overview of e-CFR XML files and associated schema. The FDsys Bulk Data repository at [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/bulkdata/](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/bulkdata/) contains the e-CFR in XML from 2015 forward. Please see FDsys at [www.fdsys.gov](http://www.fdsys.gov/) for access to the CFR Annual Edition and the _Federal Register_ in PDF format.

## 1.2. Legal Status and Authenticity of CFR Files via the FDsys Bulk Data Repository

**Q. What is the data set available for the e-CFR in XML?**

**A.        ** E–CFR files in XML have been converted and simplified from data in SGML that originates at the OFR.  The E–CFR is available in XML starting with the year 2015. Only the most recent e-CFR data will be available at endpoints on the FDsys Bulk Data Repository. Please see [www.ecfr.gov](http://www.ecfr.gov/) to search and browse a point in time edition of the e-CFR.

**Q.  Are e-CFR XML files offered on the FDsys Bulk Data Repository part of the official version of the CFR?**

**A.**  No, the XML-structured files offered for bulk download are not part of the official on-line format of the CFRor the _Federal Register_. While GPO's e-CFR XML files are based on the original source data submitted by Federal agencies and OFR/GPO markup in SGML, only the PDF and Text versions of CFRcontent on FDsys have legal status as parts of the official online format of the CFR.

**Q. Do OFR/GPO plan to include e-CFR XML files as part of the official format of the CFR?**

**A.**  No. The e-CFR XML files are provided as a snapshot of the most current CFR information in XML (with associated graphics).  For official versions of CFR information, refer to the CFR collection on FDsys at:

[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collectionCfr.action?collectionCode=CFR](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collectionCfr.action?collectionCode=CFR)

In particular, refer to the PDF versions found there.

**Q.  Are e-CFR XML bulk download files digitally signed?**

**A.  ** No, XML files available for download are not digitally signed.  They can be manipulated and enriched to operate in the various applications that users may devise.

**Q. How reliable are the metadata and the underlying tagging in bulk data files?**

**A.  ** The document markup and metadata found within bulk data files are generally reliable and complete.  However, there are variations in this underlying data due to inconsistencies in the composition and typesetting process.  As a result, some data-mining applications and user aids may not produce 100 per cent accurate results.

**Q.  What is the legal status of e-CFR user aids?**

**A.** Federal Register user aids, including, finding aids, indexes, search tools, metadata associations, and tagging schemes are not part of the legal text of the CFR.  These ancillary features help users explore and extract data, but the official legal text stands on its own.  No person should form absolute legal conclusions based on search results, finding aids, metadata associations, extractions of data, and the like.  Ultimately, only the official text of the CFR may be relied upon as evidence in a court of law.

**Q.  What is the authenticity of the e-CFR bulk data files after they have been downloaded to another site?  **

**A.**   We cannot vouch for the authenticity of data that is not under OFR/GPO control. OFR and GPO are providing free access to the e-CFR data via XML for display in various applications and mash-ups outside the FDsys domain. OFR and GPO do not endorse third party applications, and do not evaluate how our original legal content is displayed on other sites. Consumers should form their own conclusions as to whether the downloaded data can be relied upon within an application or mash-up. An application may link to the official CFR on FDsys to provide users with additional assurance.

**Q. Do OFR and GPO assert any control over downstream uses of bulk data?**

**A.**  In general, there are no restrictions on re-use of information in the e-CFR documents because U.S. Government works are not subject to copyright. OFR and GPO do not restrict downstream uses of the e-CFR data, except that independent providers should be aware that only the OFR and GPO are entitled to represent that they are the providers of the official versions of the e-CFR and related Federal Register publications.

**Q. How can re-publishers indicate the source of the e-CFR data?**

**A**. Re-publishers of the e-CFR data may cite FDsys and OFR/GPO as the source of their data, and they are free to characterize the quality of data as it appears on their site. But private sector re-publishers are prohibited from using the seal of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) or stylized CFR logos identified in NARA regulations (36 CFR part 1200) on their products because that would unlawfully misrepresent the legal status of the material, and could falsely identify private organizations as entities of the Federal Government.

# 2. XML Version Description

The content of the XML e-CFR data provided on the FDsys Bulk Data Repository is derived from that the SGML content on which the print version is based.  In creating the XML content, the SGML content is converted to well-formed XML with minimal intervention.  The resulting XML was built this way for the following reasons:

1. It is a faithful representation of the CFR, which corresponds to the original SGML mark-up.
2. It describes the structure of the CFR, including the large structure (parts, articles, corrections, table of contents, etc.), the document structure (titles, paragraphs, sections, etc.), and semantic structure (CFR references, agency names, contact information, amendment text, etc.)
3. The SGML version on which it is based is almost fully XML-compliant since all element tags have corresponding closing tags as required in XML.

The schema of the incoming SGML content remains essentially unchanged as it is converted to XML without changing any element names. Such an approach maintains fidelity to the original data, and reduces errors that might occur in schema interpretation or further data manipulation.

The changes required to convert the SGML into well-formed XML are as follows:

1. All embedded XML prolog lines of the form `<?xml version="1.0" ?>` are removed.
2. All character entities of the form `"&<name>;"` are replaced with Unicode equivalents or replaced with something else functional.
3. An XML prolog line is prepended to the file and looks like this:
	`<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>`
4. Links to e-CFR graphics images are adjusted so that their root is as follows:?
  - [www.ecfr.gov](http://www.ecfr.gov/)
5. Standard front matter, such as, the title page and "U.S. Government Official Edition Notice" are normally already removed in the SGML version. In the rare circumstance where it is not removed in the SGML version, it is not copied to the XML version.
6. `<STYLE>` elements are removed from the XML version.

Other than the changes listed above, no SGML tags that are removed or collapsed in the resulting XML.

## 2.1. Outer XML Structure

The XML file has the following overall structure:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<DLPSTEXTCLASS>
<HEADER>
       <!-- Header information -->
</HEADER>
<TEXT>
      <BODY>
            <ECFRBRWS>
    <!-- e-CFR content -->
            </ECFRBRWS>
      </BODY>
</TEXT>
</DLPSTEXTCLASS>
```
## 2.2. Header Content

There is normally, very little information in the header section. Usually it only contains the number and the title as can be seen in the following example:


```
<FILEDESC>
  <TITLESTMT>
    <TITLE>Title 1: General Provisions</TITLE>
    <AUTHOR TYPE="nameinv"></AUTHOR>
  </TITLESTMT>
  <PUBLICATIONSTMT>
    <PUBLISHER></PUBLISHER>
    <PUBPLACE></PUBPLACE>
    <IDNO TYPE="title">1</IDNO>
    <DATE></DATE>
  </PUBLICATIONSTMT>
  <SERIESSTMT>
    <TITLE></TITLE>
  </SERIESSTMT>
</FILEDESC>
<PROFILEDESC>
  <TEXTCLASS>
    <KEYWORDS></KEYWORDS>
  </TEXTCLASS>
</PROFILEDESC>
```

## 2.3. Sectioning of Body Content

The sectioning of content is managed through the use of` <DIV#>` elements, where # represents a digit such as 1, 2, 3, etc.  For example, the first` <DIV#>` element in the file should be for the Title itself and looks like this:

```
<DIV1 N="1" NODE="5:1" TYPE="TITLE">
```

This indicates that the top level section is a Title and all other `<DIV#>` elements will fall in nested layers within this one.  For the `<DIV1>` element, the value of attribute, N, is the volume number.  For titles that have no volumes, this is "1".  The value of the attribute NODE is a structured value for internal use and may be changed at any time, so it should not be relied on.

In other `<DIV#>` elements, the attribute, N, will be the "number" of the section and the attribute, "TYPE", will be the type of section.  For example, for sub-chapter B, the `<DIV#>` element might read:

` <DIV4 N="B" NODE="1:1.0.1.2" TYPE="SUBCHAP">`

Now since the `<DIV#>` elements are nested within the parent sections that they belong the overall structure may look something like this:

```
<DIV1 N="1" NODE="1:1" TYPE="TITLE">
  …
  <DIV3 N="I" NODE="1:1.0.1" TYPE="CHAPTER">
    …
    <DIV4 N="A" NODE="1:1.0.1.1" TYPE="SUBCHAP">
      …
      <DIV5 N="1" NODE="1:1.0.1.1.1" TYPE="PART">
        …
        <DIV8 N="§ 1.1" NODE="1:1.0.1.1.1.0.1.1" TYPE="SECTION">
          …
        </DIV8>
        …
      </DIV5>
      <DIV5 N="2" NODE="1:1.0.1.1.2" TYPE="PART">
        …
        <DIV8 N="§ 2.1" NODE="1:1.0.1.1.2.0.1.1" TYPE="SECTION">
          …
        </DIV8>
        <DIV8 N="§ 2.2" NODE="1:1.0.1.1.2.0.1.2" TYPE="SECTION">
          …
        </DIV8>
        <DIV8 N="§ 2.3" NODE="1:1.0.1.1.2.0.1.3" TYPE="SECTION">
          …
        </DIV8>
        …
      </DIV5>
      <DIV5 N="3" NODE="1:1.0.1.1.3" TYPE="PART">
        …
        <DIV8 N="§ 3.1" NODE="1:1.0.1.1.3.0.1.1" TYPE="SECTION">
          …
        </DIV8>
        <DIV8 N="§ 3.2" NODE="1:1.0.1.1.3.0.1.2" TYPE="SECTION">
          …
        </DIV8>
        <DIV8 N="§ 3.3" NODE="1:1.0.1.1.3.0.1.3" TYPE="SECTION">
          …
        </DIV8>
        …
      </DIV5>
      …
    </DIV4>
    <DIV4 N="B" NODE="1:1.0.1.2" TYPE="SUBCHAP">
      …
```

Note that though there are `<DIV8>` elements, there are no `<DIV6>` or `<DIV7>` elements in the example above.  While the higher number DIV elements are always nested within lower number DIV elements, they are not required to be sequential.

The title of a section is almost always given by the `<HEAD>` element immediately following the `<DIV#>` element, for example:


```
<DIV4 N="B" NODE="5:1.0.1.2" TYPE="SUBCHAP">
<HEAD>SUBCHAPTER B—CIVIL SERVICE REGULATIONS</HEAD>
```

Note that the `<DIV#>` elements are consistent in their meaning as shown below:

1. DIV1 => TYPE="TITLE"
2. DIV2 => TYPE="SUBTITLE"
3. DIV3 => TYPE="CHAPTER"
4. DIV4 => TYPE="SUBCHAP"
5. DIV5 => TYPE="PART"
6. DIV6 => TYPE="SUBPART"
7. DIV7 => TYPE=" SUBJGRP"
8. DIV8 => TYPE="SECTION"
9. DIV9 => TYPE="APPENDIX"

## 2.4. Paragraphs

The `<P>` element and other elements that are closely related to it (examples: `<PSPACE>`, `<FP>`, `<P-1>`, etc.) are used extensively in the content sections to separate paragraphs.  While paragraphs are often itemized points in an enumerated list with nested sub-lists, the numbering scheme is hardcoded in the content and there is no nesting of elements to preserve indentation levels.  For example:

```
<DIV8 N="§ 151.101" NODE="5:1.0.1.2.12.0.1.1" TYPE="SECTION">
<HEAD>§ 151.101   Definitions.</HEAD>
<P>In this part: </P>
<P>(a) <I>State</I> means a State or territory or possession of the United States. </P>
<P>(b) <I>State or local agency</I> means:</P>
<P>(1) The executive branch of a State, municipality, or other political subdivision of a State, or an agency or department thereof; or</P>
<P>(2) The executive branch of the District of Columbia, or an agency or department thereof.</P>
<P>(c) <I>Federal agency</I> means an executive agency or other agency of the United States, but does not include a member bank of the Federal Reserve System; </P>
<P>(d) <I>State or local officer or employee</I> means an individual employed by a State or local agency whose principal employment is in connection with an activity which is financed in whole or in part by loans or grants made by the United States or a Federal agency but does not include—</P>
<P>(1) An individual who exercises no functions in connection with that activity.</P>
<P>(2) An individual employed by an educational or research institution, establishment, agency, or system which is supported in whole or in part by—</P>
<P>(i) A State or political subdivision thereof;</P>
<P>(ii) The District of Columbia; or</P>
<P>(iii) A recognized religious, philanthropic, or cultural organization.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Political party</I> means a National political party, a State political party, and an affiliated organization. </P>
<P>(f) <I>Election</I> includes a primary, special, and general election. </P>
<P>(g) <I>Nonpartisan election</I> means an election at which none of the candidates is to be nominated or elected as representing a political party any of whose candidates for Presidential elector receives votes in the last preceding election at which Presidential electors were selected. </P>
<P>(h) <I>Partisan</I> when used as an adjective refers to a political party. </P>
<P>(i) <I>Elective office</I> means any office which is voted upon at an election as defined at § 151.101(f), above, but does not include political party office. </P>
<CITA TYPE="N">[40 FR 42733, Sept. 16, 1975, as amended at 79 FR 25484, May 5, 2014]
</CITA>
</DIV8>
```

The proper indentation of the items in the aforementioned example should probably be as follows:

```
(a)_State_ means a State or territory ...
(b)_State or local agency_ means:
   (1)The executive branch of a State, municipality, ...
   (2)The executive of the District of Columbia, ...
(c)_Federal agency_ means and executive agency or...
(d)_State or local officer or employee_ means an...
   (1)An individual who exercises no functions in ...
   (2)An individual employed by and educational or .
      (i)A State or political subdivision thereof...
      (ii)The District of Columbia; or
      (iii)A recognized religious, philanthropic, or 
          ...
(e)_Political party_ means a National political party, 
(f)_Election_ includes a primary, special, and ...
(g)_Nonpartisan election_ means an election at which ...
(h)_Partisan_ when used as an adjective refers to ...
(i)_Elective office_ means any office which is voted...
```
However, this is not deducible from the XML syntax alone.


## 2.5. Images

If an e-CFR Title has images, they will be in either GIF and/or PDF format.  They will usually be referenced as in the following example:

```
<DIV9 N="Appendix A" NODE="2:1.2.25.3.2.11.51.1.16" TYPE="APPENDIX">
  <HEAD>Appendix A to Part 3485—Covered Transactions</HEAD>
  <img src="http://www.ecfr.gov/graphics/er28mr12.000.gif"/>
  <P/>
  <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/graphics/pdfs/er28mr12.000.pdf">View or download PDF</a>
  <P/><P/>
</DIV9>
```

As per the example above there are usually both a low-resolution image in GIF format and a high-resolution version by the same base name in PDF format. These links will access the correct images online. However, they are also available in a graphics ZIP archive on the FDsys Bulk Data Repository in the same location as the XML rendition. All the GIF files are in the "graphics" folder within the ZIP file and all the PDF files are within the "pdfs" subfolder.

- ZIP archive
  - o.graphics (folder)
    - er28mr12.000.gif
    - ...
    - pdfs (folder)
      - er28mr12.000.pdf
      - ...

# 3.Alphabetical List of XML Elements

The XML elements that appear in the Titles of the e-CFR are listed below with a brief description of their meaning.  In some cases, the description may include one of the following in square brackets, i.e. [], to show where they are typically used. Note that additional elements may appear in addition to the elements listed below.

- B -- Back Matter
- C -- Table of Contents
- F -- Front Matter
- T -- General textual content

## 3.1. a

This element defines a hyperlink, which is used to link a URL. The most important attribute of the `<a>` element is the "href" attribute, which indicates the link's destination. This is most frequently used to link to an image in the e-CFR Titles.

```
  <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/graphics/pdfs/er28mr12.000.pdf">View or download PDF</a>
```
## 3.2. ABBR

This element presents a list of abbreviations or acronyms. It is only ever observed inside the `<CFRTOC>` element. [C]

```
<ABBR>
<HED>Abbreviations Used in This Chapter:</HED>
<P>ATF = <I>Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.</I> </P>
<P>TD = <I>Treasury Decision.</I></P>
<P>TTB = <I>Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.</I></P>
</ABBR>
```

## 3.3. AC

The accent function places certain diacritical marks at letters. The `<AC>` tag follows the letter modified. Usage is `<AC T='d'>` where d is a single digit 0-9:


|Digit|Character|
|-----|--|
|0|&#124;|
|1|é|
|2|	è|
|3|	ê|
|4|ë|
|5|&#9633;|		
|6|	ñ
|7|	å|
|8|	~|
|9|	ç|


These can be used for any letters. Entities (e.g., &eacute;) can accomplish the same effects and are preferable, because they are more intelligible.

```
<FP>and, <I>x<AC T="8"/></I> is the sample mean; n is the number of samples;
and x<E T="52">i</E> is the i<E T="51">th</E> sample; Or,</FP>
```

## 3.4. ALPHHD

This is an alphabet separator heading in agency indexes, i.e. the `<SUBCHIND>` element. [T, B]

```
<HED>INDEX I—RULES RELATING TO PATENTS</HED>
<EDNOTE>
<HED>Editorial Note:</HED><PSPACE>This listing is provided for informational purposes only. It is compiled and kept current by the Department of Commerce. This index is updated as of July 1, 2012.</PSPACE></EDNOTE>

<SUBJECT>Abandoned applications:</SUBJECT>
<SUBJ1L>Abandonment by failure to prosecute</SUBJ1L>
<PT>1.135</PT>
<SUBJ1L>Abandonment during interference</SUBJ1L>
```

## 3.5. AMDDATE

This is the amendment date of the title.  This is always found just inside the `<ECFRBRWS>` element.

```
<BODY>
<ECFRBRWS>
<AMDDATE>May 1, 2014</AMDDATE>
<DIV1 N="1" NODE="37:1" TYPE="TITLE">
```

## 3.6. APP
This indicates an appendix, exhibit or supplement heading as contents entry. [C, T]

```
<CFRTOC>
  <EDNOTE>
    <HED>Editorial Note:</HED>

## 3.7. APPRO

This is an OMB number approval note in parentheses. [T]

```
<DIV8 N="§ 1305.3" NODE="5:3.0.2.2.5.0.48.3" TYPE="SECTION">
  <HEAD>§ 1305.3   Procedures in the event of a demand for disclosure.</HEAD>
  <P>(a) Whenever a demand is made upon an employee or former employee of OMB ... </P>

  <APPRO TYPE="N">(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 0348–0056)</APPRO>
</DIV8>
```

## 3.8. AUTH

This is an authority statement that usually contains a mini-header.  Almost every `<DIV#>` element has one.

```
<DIV5 N="1" NODE="37:1.0.1.1.1" TYPE="PART">
<HEAD>PART 1—RULES OF PRACTICE IN PATENT CASES</HEAD>
<AUTH>
  <HED>Authority:</HED>
  <PSPACE>35 U.S.C. 2(b)(2), unless otherwise noted.</PSPACE>
</AUTH>
<SOURCE>
  <HED>Source:</HED>
  <PSPACE>24 FR 10332, Dec. 22, 1959, unless otherwise noted.</PSPACE>
</SOURCE>
```

## 3.9. AUTHOR

This element designates an author although there are currently no examples of where an author is actually named.  The TYPE attribute has been observed to have the value "nameinv" or "author".

```
<TITLESTMT>
  <TITLE>Title 37: Patents, Trademarks, and Copyrights</TITLE>
  <AUTHOR TYPE="nameinv"></AUTHOR>
</TITLESTMT>
```

## 3.10. B

This element represents a span of text stylistically different from normal text, without conveying any special importance or relevance. It is typically used for keywords in a summary, product names in a review, or other spans of text whose typical presentation would be boldfaced. Another example of its use is to mark the lead sentence of each paragraph of an article.

Note:  The `<B>` element should not be confused with the `<strong>` or `<em>` elements. The `<strong>` element represents text of certain importance, while `<em>` puts some emphasis on the text.  The `<b>` element does not convey such special semantic information; it is used when the others do not fit.

```
<P>(ii) $10,000; whichever is higher, unless the employee has elected a Living Benefit under subpart K of this part. Effective for pay periods beginning on or after October 30, 1998, there is no maximum BIA. <B>Note:</B> If an employee's pay is "capped" by law, the amount of the Basic insurance is based on the capped amount, which is the amount the employee is actually being paid. It is not based on the amount the employee's pay would have been without the pay cap.</P>
```

## 3.11. BCAP
