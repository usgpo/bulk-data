# 1.Introduction

The U.S. Government Publishing Office (GPO) and the National Archives' Office of the Federal Register (OFR) partnership is offering bulk data downloads of Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) files to the general public via Data.gov and FDsys. This effort began when the President challenged Federal agencies to create a more open and transparent government, promote accountability, and provide information to citizens about what their Government is doing (see [74 FR 4685, January 26, 2009](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2009-01-26/pdf/E9-1777.pdf)).

The [Public Printer's letter of March 9, 2009](http://www.gpo.gov/pdfs/news-media/letter\_030909.pdf) pledged to provide trusted information in whatever form is required to meet the President's objectives. &nbsp;

In addition, the Office of the Federal Register coordinates with the Office of Science Technology Policy to ensure that the OFR/GPO partnership meets customer expectations. To follow through on our commitment, we are expanding and accelerating the development of FDsys to provide XML-structured content as rendered output. &nbsp;This will give users access to masses of data to reconfigure and redistribute as they wish to meet the specialized needs of their constituencies.

## 1.1.Purpose

The purpose of this document is to provide an overview of Code of Federal Regulations XML files and associated schema. The FDsys Bulk Data repository at http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/bulkdata/ contains the Code of Federal Regulations in XML from 2007 to the present and additional years will be added as they become available. Please see FDsys at [www.fdsys.gov](http://www.fdsys.gov/) for access to the Code of Federal Regulations in PDF and HTML formats. &nbsp;

## 1.2.Legal Status & Authenticity of Code of Federal Regulations files via Data.gov

&nbsp;

**Q. What is the data set available for the Code of Federal Regulations in XML?**

**A. ** Code of Federal Regulations files in XML have been converted and simplified from the SGML rendition used for the printed publication. The Code of Federal Regulations is available in XML starting with the year 2000, when GPO began composing the Code of Federal Regulations in SGML. OFR/GPO plan to convert the remaining electronic data set at a future date.

&nbsp;

**Q. &nbsp;Are bulk data downloads of XML files offered on FDsys via Data.gov and FDsys part of the official version of the Code of Federal Regulations?**

**A.** No, the XML-structured files offered for bulk download are not part of the official on-line format of the _Code of Federal Regulations_. While GPO's XML files are based on the original source data submitted by Federal agencies, OFR markup, and GPO typesetting and composition markup in SGML, only the PDF and Text versions of _Code of Federal Regulations_ content on GPO Access and FDsys have legal status as parts of the official online format of the _Code of Federal Regulations_. &nbsp;Additional development will be required before OFR/GPO can specify that XML files are a part of the official online edition of the _Code of Federal Regulations_. &nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Q. Do OFR/GPO plan to include XML files as part of the official format of the Code of Federal Regulations?**

**A.** Yes. The current set of XML-structured material (minus graphics) is not yet characterized as part of the official online _Code of Federal Regulations_ format because the underlying data used to create a viewable rendition of the material must be thoroughly scrutinized and tested. The XML-structured files are derived from SGML-tagged data and printing codes, which may produce anomalies in display. &nbsp;For example, complex tabular material in XML files may not display as correctly composed objects equivalent to the tables that appear in the Text and PDF files. &nbsp;Tabular material that displays in an ambiguous or distorted manner could affect the substantive meaning of regulations and other documents.
Our goal is to clean up the XML data and develop associated style sheets to the point that the XML rendition can be characterized as a display format of the official online edition. We are also developing the means to embed graphics in the files, so that an XML version may be deemed both official and complete. The OFR will issue a _Federal Register Bulletin_ to alert users when the XML-structured files are ready to be included as part of the official online edition. 

&nbsp;

**Q. &nbsp;What is the legal basis for making determinations about official status?**

**A.** The Federal Register Act established the Administrative Committee of the Federal Register (Administrative Committee or ACFR) as the regulatory body with authority to determine the format(s) of its official publications, including the Code of Federal Regulations(44 U.S.C. Ch. 15). Under 1 CFR 8.6(a), the official formats approved by the ACFR include a paper edition, a microfiche edition, and an online edition. OFR and GPO carry out ACFR regulations by developing appropriate means to display _Code of Federal Regulations_ material in the official formats.

&nbsp;

**Q. When did the Code of Federal Regulations first appear online?**

**A.** The first official volumes were published online in 1996. The first full online edition dates to 1997 as authorized by resolution of the Administrative Committee and its regulations at 1 CFR 8.6, and by Public Law 103-40 (the Government Printing Office Electronic Information Enhancement Act of 1993; codified at 44 U.S.C. 4101).

&nbsp;

**Q. &nbsp;Are Code of Federal Regulations XML bulk download files digitally signed?**

**A.** No, XML files available for download are not digitally signed. They can be manipulated and enriched to operate in the various applications that users may devise. GPO is evaluating technology that could be used to digitally sign XML files for future official editions posted on FDsys.  Adding signed non-PDF files to FDsys would be an enhancement for FDsys users, but would not be used to restrict or adversely affect the XML bulk data downloads available to our customers. 

&nbsp;

**Q. &nbsp;What does the term "digitally signed" mean?**

**A.** Currently, GPO uses digital signature technology on PDF documents to add a visible Seal of Authenticity (a graphic of an eagle) to authenticated and certified documents. The technology allows GPO to secure data integrity, and provide users with assurance that the content is unchanged since it was disseminated by GPO. A signed and certified document also displays a blue ribbon icon to the left of the Seal of Authenticity and in the Signatures tab within Adobe Acrobat or Reader. When users print a document that has been signed and certified by GPO, the Seal of Authenticity will automatically print on the document, but the blue ribbon will not print.

&nbsp;

**Q. How reliable is the metadata and the underlying tagging in bulk data files?**

**A.** The document markup and metadata found within bulk data files are generally reliable and complete.  However, there are variations in this underlying data due to inconsistencies in the composition and typesetting process. As a result, some data-mining applications and user aids may not produce 100 per cent accurate results. 

&nbsp;
**Q. What is the legal status of Code of Federal Regulations user aids?**

**A.** Code of Federal Regulations user aids, including, finding aids, indexes, search tools, metadata associations, and tagging schemes are not part of the legal text of the _Code of Federal Regulations_. These ancillary features help users explore and extract data, but the official legal text stands on its own. No person should form absolute legal conclusions based on search results, finding aids, metadata associations, extractions of data, and the like. Ultimately, only the official text of the _Code of Federal Regulations_ may be relied upon as evidence in a court of law. 

**Q. What is the authenticity of Code of Federal Regulations bulk data files after they have been downloaded to another site? &nbsp;**

**A.**  We cannot vouch for the authenticity of data that is not under OFR/GPO control. OFR and GPO are providing free access to Code of Federal Regulations data via XML for display in various applications and mash-ups outside the FDsys domain. The OFR/GPO partnership does not endorse third party applications, and does not evaluate how our original legal content is displayed on other sites. Consumers should form their own conclusions as to whether the downloaded data can be relied upon within an application or mash-up. An application may link to the official _Code of Federal Regulations_ on FDsys to provide users with additional assurance. 

&nbsp;

**Q. Do OFR and GPO assert any control over downstream uses of bulk data?**

**A.** In general, there are no restrictions on re-use of information in Code of Federal Regulations material because U.S. Government works are not subject to copyright. OFR and GPO do not restrict downstream uses of Code of Federal Regulations data, except that independent providers should be aware that only the OFR and GPO are entitled to represent that they are the providers of the official versions of the _Code of Federal Regulations_ and related Federal Register publications. 

&nbsp;

**Q. How can re-publishers indicate the source of Code of Federal Regulations data?**

**A**. Re-publishers of Code of Federal Regulations data may cite FDsys and OFR/GPO as the source of their data, and they are free to characterize the quality of data as it appears on their site. But private sector re-publishers are prohibited from using the seal of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) or stylized Code of Federal Regulations logos identified in NARA regulations (36 CFR part 1200) on their products because that would unlawfully misrepresent the legal status of the material, and could falsely identify private organizations as entities of the Federal Government.

&nbsp;

#2 Schema Description

The schema chosen to represent the Code of Federal Regulations is a simplified version of the SGML schema that is used as part of the print production process, with some presentation and print specific tags removed or collapsed, and then converted to well-formed XML. This schema was chosen for the following reasons:

1. It is a complete and faithful representation of the Code of Federal Regulations, which matches most closely to the author's original intent.
2. It describes the data using semantic tags in a way that is appropriate to the Code of Federal Regulations Domain. For example, `<TOC>`, `<CITE>`, `<SECTION>`, and `<CHAPTER>` are all tags in this schema but they are not a complete set of all possible tags.
3. It fully describes the structure of the Code of Federal Regulations, including the large structure (chapters, parts, sections, etc.), the document structure (paragraphs, etc.), and semantic structure.

Since the schema is not an authoring schema and the SGML to XML conversion process maintains the order of the tags, this allows the XML schema to be more permissive than if it were used for checking authored content.

The schema being produced for this effort describes the data as it actually occurs from the OFR. Documents are not being cleaned up because they do not match the schema; instead, the schema was selectively relaxed. Such an approach maintains 100% fidelity to the original data, and eliminates any errors that might occur in schema interpretation or further data manipulation.

The following table lists the SGML tags that were removed or collapsed into a source attribute in the Code of Federal Regulations XML.

## 2.2 Table of Contents, Explanatory Text, Title Number, and Finding Aid Entries 

This section describes the top-level structure of Code of the Federal Regulations XML file.

The XML schema, being a translated reproduction of the SGML schema, contains tags and content in the same order as they appear in the printed document. Major sections are grouped appropriately (`<TOC>`, `<PART>`, `<SUBPART>`, `<CITE>`, `<EXPLA>`, `<SECTION>`, `<CHAPTER>`, `<ALPHLIST>`), and all data and tags are represented  with the exception of the reduced tags from the previous section. **The XML tags above are not a complete set of what is available in the Code of Federal Regulations.**

The XML tags and their descriptions of the TOC schema above is shown below:

| XML Tag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| CFRDOC | The root tag for all document types in Code of Federal Regulations publications. This tag includes children such as TOC, CITE, EXPLA, SECTION, CHAPTER and ALPHLIST. Note: These children are not a complete set of tags. See the CFRDOC.XSD for more details.  |
| TOC | Contains the main table of contents in major divisions of publication. |
| TITLENO | Contains title number in tables of contents. |
| SUBTI | Contains subtitle head in table of contents. |
| PGHD | Usually, it contains the word "Page" when it appears as a heading. |
| EXPL | Used for explanatory data following the "Cite this Code" page. |
| SUBJECT | Contains subject of section, usually follows section number. |
| PG | Used for page number data in lists. |
| CHAPTI | Contains chapter division in tables of contents sections. |
| FAIDS | Finding Aids entries |

&nbsp;

An abbreviated example of the overall section and structure is below:

&nbsp;

### 2.2.2 XPath Examples

The schema allows for a wide variety XPath commands for extracting items:

//SECTION ? outputs all sections within Code of Federal Regulations document.

(//SECTION/SECTNO ? Returns all the section numbers.

(//SECTION/SUBJECT ? Returns all the subjects within all sections.

//SECTION[descendant::PRTPAGE/@P = 'iii'] ? Returns section contents which contains page iii.

## 2.3 TITLE, CHAPTER, PART and SUBPART 

The TITLE, CHAPTER, PART and SUBPART tags are organized in an xml structure that is defined below and contains logical divisions in the Code of Federal Regulations. For example, each title is divided into chapters, which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts that cover specific regulatory areas. Large parts may be subdivided into subparts. All parts are organized in sections, and most citations in the CFR are provided at the section level.

&nbsp;

The XML tags and their descriptions of the schema above are shown below:

&nbsp;

| XML Tag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| TITLE | Contains a major group of the publication. |
| SUBCHAP | Contains a major division within a Chapter. |
| CONTENTS | Contains table of contents entries. |
| SECHD | Usually used for the words "Section" or "Sec." when it appears as heading. |
| SECTNO | Used for the CFR section number. |
| SUBJECT | Subject of Section, usually follows Section Number. |
| APP | Used for Appendix head entries in tables of contents. |
| CHAPTER | Contains a major division within Title and Subtitle. |
| PART | Contains a major division within Chapters and Subchapters. |
| EAR | Used to override default entry for first or last section number in running head. |
| SUBPART | Contains a major division within Part. |
| RESERVED | Used mostly for units that are reserved for future use, and therefore contain no data at this time. |

&nbsp;

The abbreviated example of the TITLE, CHAPTER, PART and SUBPART tags are shown below.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## 2.4.Cite This Code 

Cite this code section holds the first text line of cite this code pages followed by explanatory data. The contents of a CITE always includes a CITEP paragraph on the regulation. Cite this code section is followed by EXPLA section which explains the data of Code of Federal Regulations. The signature block is often followed by EXPLA section and may contain empty xml values. &nbsp; &nbsp;

The XML tags and their descriptions of the schema above are shown below:

&nbsp;

| XML Tag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| CITE | Contains the first text line of "cite this code" page. |
| CITEP | Contains "To Cite ..." paragraph on cite this code page in front matter |
| EXPLA | Used for explanatory data following the "Cite this Code" page in the front matter |
| IPAR | Contains lead material on first page of explanation section of the front matter. |
| STUB | Contains the back part of lead material. |
| SIDEHED | Used within explanatory data following the "Cite this Code" page in the front matter. |
| SIG | Used to designate a signature block. |
| NAME | Used for person's name. |
| POSITION | Used to denote the job title only in signature blocks. |
| OFFICE | Used for the "Office of the Federal Register" line in the signature block of the explanation pages of the Front matter. |
| DATE | Used for date entry. |

## 2.5.The Contents of Section

The contents of section tags are the ones that usually describe the majority of the data in the Code of Federal Regulations. In some cases, the section includes XML GPOTABLE tags which describe elements of tables and their data. Section tag always contains a section number which is usually followed by a subject of that section. A paragraph or XML tag P is used to denote large or small text in the section. In some cases, a section may also contain a citation.

&nbsp;

| XML Tag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| SECTION | Contains group or container tag for search and retrieval purposes. |
| SECTNO | Used for the code of Federal Regulations section number. |
| SUBJECT | Contains subject of section, usually follows section number. |
| GPOTABLE | Defines the elements necessary to produce the structure of GPO tables. |
| BOXHD | Generation of box heads delimiter. It is used only if there are actual CHEDs in the table. |
| CHED | Generation of column boxheads. Do not use if there are no actual CHEDs in the table. |
| ROW | Generation row delimiter. |
| ENT | Generation table body cell. |
| CITA | Used for citations. |

&nbsp;

The contents will roughly have the same structure:

&nbsp;

```<CFRDOC>
 .
 .
 .

 <SECTION>  
   <SECTNO>§ 1007.51</SECTNO>  
   <SUBJECT>Class I differential, adjustments to Class I prices...</SUBJECT>  
   <P>(a) The Class I differential shall be the differential...</P>
